< LOGIN PROCESS >

The user enters their information in the login form. When they click submit, the information is sent to the server. When the server recieves 
the client request, it queries the database for the user and their password. If the database returns an empty set of rows (no username match), the 
server sends the client an invalid user/password message. If the database returns a row (user found), the server checks if the passwords match. 
If they do not match, the server sends the client an invalid user/password message. If the passwords do match, the server sends the client a 
successful login message.
